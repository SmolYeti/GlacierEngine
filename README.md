# Glacier Engine
"A glacier (US: /ˈɡleɪʃər/; UK: /ˈɡlæsiər, ˈɡleɪsiər/) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight."

The Glacier Engine is the start of a game engine that will constantly be changing and evolving over time. It is called the glacier engine because, like any code base, it will "slowly [flow] and [deform] under stresses induced by its weight", though my goal will be to keep the code clean and usable as time goes on.

This is a project to practice and grow my Vulkan library and knowledge. Plan is for this to being a somewhat compitent game engine or etc, but we will see.
